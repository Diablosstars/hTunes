The program is a mini clone of iTunes, hTunes.  The
 application supports adding songs to various playlists, with a built in saving system
 and media player to listen to your songs.

 The only bug that we know about is the lack of album artwork from lastFM.

 We added the ability to rename and delete playlists via context menu.

 Christian did the initial setup of the project, getting files in place, setting up a skeleton, 
 , the drag portion of Drag and Drop, and others. 

 JME did the cleanup work, filling out functions, the drop portion of Drag and Drop, etc.

 We believe that we each did 50% of the work.
